# todos

## Requirements

- Use classes and objects for todos
- Use Javascript to generate DOM (SPA)
- Use webpack to bundle prod, dev versions (webpack merge)
- Separate application logic from DOM-related stuff
- Use webstorage api to store todos
  - Make sure to handle exceptions so that the app doesn't crash with missing data

## Todos:

1. handle dropon on nav item (div ok, its child not ok)
2. general nav items styling to match
3. main nav item emoticons
4. responsive
5. refactor js
6. FIXME: whatTodo? abs logo is appearing
7. todoDetailIsFinishedDiv btn styling
8. colors (https://maketintsandshades.com/, https://colorable.jxnblk.com/dc143c/ffffff, )
9. typography (https://typescale.com/)

## Use case scenarios

- User should have a default project to which all of their todos are put
- User should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
- User should be able to create new todos
- User should be able to view all projects
- User should be able to view all todos in each project (title and duedate, changing color for different priorities)
- User should be able to expand a single todo to see/edit its details
- User should be able to delete a todo

## Suggestions

- Make use of libraries from [npm](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns)
