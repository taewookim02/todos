# todos

## Requirements

- Use classes and objects for todos
- Use Javascript to generate DOM (SPA)
- Use webpack to bundle prod, dev versions (webpack merge)
- Separate application logic from DOM-related stuff
- Use webstorage api to store todos
  - Make sure to handle exceptions so that the app doesn't crash with missing data

## Todos:

1. change bottom btn to New Todo + on mobile when todo screen is open
2. Main nav item styling
3. todo-container styling
4. todo checkbox styling
5. typography
6. colors
7. handle dropon on nav item (div ok, its child not ok)
8. main nav item emoticons
9. responsive
10. refactor js

## Use case scenarios

- User should have a default project to which all of their todos are put
- User should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
- User should be able to create new todos
- User should be able to view all projects
- User should be able to view all todos in each project (title and duedate, changing color for different priorities)
- User should be able to expand a single todo to see/edit its details
